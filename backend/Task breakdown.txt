What we will need to do to make app functional

1. Migrations: Run makemigrations and migrate to apply your model changes.

2. Admin setup: Register models in admin.py to manage from Django admin.

3. User registration/login API endpoints: If not done already.

4. Ride request logic: Match riders with drivers, manage status updates.

5. Permissions & authentication: Ensure users can only access what they should.

6. Frontend state management: Ensure smooth UI interactions and feedback.

7. Deployment setup: Host backend (e.g., on Render) and frontend (e.g., on Vercel or Netlify).

8. Error handling & validation: Handle edge cases and form errors.

9. Styling and UX: Make sure it looks and feels good to use.

10. Real-time features (optional): Websockets for live driver location, ride updates, etc.
